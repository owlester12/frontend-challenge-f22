This is my Front end technical challenge. All of the features should be functionalâ€“
you can see the description by clicking on a course, add courses to cart
by clicking the add course button (and remove them by clicking the remove
course button), you can filter the course by number by clicking the 
100s, 200s, 300s, and 400s button (initially all the filters are "selected"),
as well as search for courses in the search bar and checkout the course cart
by clicking the checkout button in the navigation bar. 

I don't have that much experience with React (or any with typescript), so
I know my typescript types are pretty off and I didn't use a state manager
like redux. I know that my code is pretty messy and some of the css and React 
components are redundant. However, I was able to learn so much about React over the last
three days while doing the challenge, and I am sure I will be able to 
learn a lot more over the rest of the semester. Like my application said, I have
a lot of time this semester to learn more about web development and am very motivated
to do so. I hope you like this website.
